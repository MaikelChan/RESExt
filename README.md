# RESExt

Tool to extract and insert certain `.BIN` files from Resident Evil Survivor. Extracted files don't contain file names, but if it detects that it's extracting a `.TIM` image file, it will add the proper extension.

## Usage

```
Extract: -e <SourceFile> [<OutputFolder>]
 Insert: -i <SourceFolder> [<OutputFile>]
```
